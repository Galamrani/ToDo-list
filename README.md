Welcome to my TodoList App, a sleek and functional task management tool designed to help stay organized and focused. Whether you are a busy professional, a student juggling assignments, or simply someone who wants to keep track of their daily tasks.

## Overview

The TodoList App is a web-based application built using Node.js and the Express framework, with data storage handled by MongoDB. This app allows users to create, view, and manage their to-do list items effortlessly. With its clean and intuitive user interface, you can easily add tasks, mark them as completed, and remove them when they're no longer needed.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The app boasts a user-centric design that provides a seamless experience. It's easy to understand and navigate, ensuring a hassle-free task management process.

- **Real-time Updates:** As you add or remove tasks, the app instantly updates the display, reflecting the changes you've made without requiring page refreshes.

- **Persistent Data:** All your to-do list items are stored securely in a MongoDB database, ensuring your tasks are saved even if you close the app or refresh the page.

- **Date Tagging:** Each to-do item is tagged with the date it was added, giving you a sense of when each task was created.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** The backend of the application is built on Node.js, which provides a robust environment for server-side scripting.

- **Express:** The Express framework is used to create a RESTful API, handle routing, and manage HTTP requests and responses.

- **MongoDB:** The MongoDB database is employed to store and manage the to-do list items. The Mongoose library is used to interact with MongoDB in a structured manner.

- **EJS:** The app utilizes the EJS (Embedded JavaScript) templating engine to dynamically generate HTML content and render data on the front end.
